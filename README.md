# 2007-Interboard-DCC
Method of connecting the DCC bus over baseboard limits
The suggested solution consists of a PCB design that the user cuts in two. One piece is installed on the first baseboard and the other piece on the
second baseboard. The two pieces are connected together by a ribbon cable. This is permanently connected to the piece on one of the baseboards
and plugs into the other piece. The cable can thus not get lost. Th two pieces are not identical. One piece has provision for a snubber across the DCC bus.
